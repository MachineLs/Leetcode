# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.
SELECT Name AS "Customers"
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE o.customerId is NULL #Having WHERE Orders.CustomerID is null will exclude any customer who is present in the orders table.

因为我们要找的是在order没下单的客户,所以必须有WHERE o.customerId is NULL
实验了下如果是 is not null 返回的是已经下单的客户
